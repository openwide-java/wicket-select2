wicket-select2
==============

Wicket components and behaviors for [Select2](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2).
These classes expose all Select2 use cases: single or multiple selects, and select
options derived from HTML or AJAX queries.

The Maven project builds a JAR with the one behavior and two components. The test code
includes Select2DemoApplication which is a simple Wicket application whose public
static main() starts it in an embedded Jetty instance at http://localhost:8081. The
home page, Select2DemoPage, shows various ways you can use Select2 to decorate your
components.

Existing DropDownChoice and ListMultipleChoice components in your application can be
Select2-ified with a single line of code:
    component.add(Select2Behavior.forChoice(component)).
    
To filter and populate select options with AJAX queries, use Select2SingleChoice or
Select2MultipleChoice. Each of these requires an ISelect2AjaxAdapter instance which
implements the query logic and id/display mapping. See StateAdapter (from the demo) and
the Select2TagAdapter for simple examples.

Please note: Select2 requires jQuery. The Select2Behavior does not import jQuery.
You need to do this yourself. (I didn't want to impose a specific version and hosted
location on you.)

Feedback is welcome.
